<p><b>Launch apps by saying your favorite phrase or word!</b></p>
<p>VK Launcher lets you harness the power of Google Voice Search to start any application on your Android
device by saying a keyword that you define. An unlimited amount of keywords can be created and backed up
to external storage.</p>
<hr/>
<p><small>Admittedly, this app has been deprecated a bit thanks to Google Now, but at the time there wasn't
anything like it in the store.  Still, maybe it has some utility for certain individuals.</small></p>
