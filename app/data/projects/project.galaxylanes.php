<p>Yup! Bowling. Completely out of left field for me. The <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/category/ld-30/" target="_blank">Ludum Dare 30</a>
theme fulfillment of "connected worlds" was intended to be that the bowling balls would all look like
planets, and they'd "connect" with the pins down the end.</p>

<p>A stretch, I admit it. Unfortunately, this is incomplete. I got a lot done in the 72-hour period, but I
did more work with Blender than I'd expected to, among other things.</p>
