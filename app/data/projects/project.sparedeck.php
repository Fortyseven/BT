<p><i>"Lose the deck of AR cards for your favorite video game console? This free Android app might be
able to help..."</i></p>
<br/>
<p>This is an Android app I actually had taken down by Nintendo off of the Google Play Store. <i>Spare
Deck</i> is essentially a high res gallery of the AR cards that come packed with the Nintendo 3DS. It was
expanded to include the ones packed with Kid Icarus, and also the Playstation Vita.</p>

<p>The app is no longer supported, but the source code is free for whoever might be interested.</p>

<hr/>

<p><small>Spare Deck was written early in the process of learning Android, so there's probably bugs and
bad decisions everywhere.</small></p>
