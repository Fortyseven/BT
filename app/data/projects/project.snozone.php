<p><b>The War on Christmas just got stupider.</b></p>
<p>
    Bucking the theme, I wanted to create a tank battle game inspired by the original 'Battle Zone'
    arcade game. It started out that way, and got...christmassy early on.
</p>
<p>
    You're a tank in a pit of abandoned Christmas crap.  Are those rocks? Are they coal?  Doesn't
    matter: everyone is naughty in the pit, and the Snowmen are about to judge you harder than an
    anonymous teenager on the internet.
