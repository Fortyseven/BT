<p>This stupid little thing was created as both a bit of a joke, and served as my first real introduction
to Unity. It is not an actual "game".</p>

<p><i>Virtual Stuck Behind A Bus</i> was a video game played by Peter Griffin during an episode of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Guy" target="_blank">Family Guy</a>.</p>

<p>(I have more current build where I attempted to take the idea and expand it out, turning it into an actual game! I
doubt I will return to that, however.)</p>
