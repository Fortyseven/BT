    <i>"A time long ago, a lone laser defense platform was our people's last line of defense against a
    raging meteor storm. And now, the storm has come again -- and this time, our enemies are taking
    advantage of it. Defend us, once more!"</i></p>
    <p>As a life long fan of Mattel's amazing Astrosmash arcade shooter for the Intellivision, creating
    a remake of it has been something I've always started, but never finished. I have half-finished
    versions in C++, Flash, and more. When I finally settled on Unity for game development, I wanted to
    get this out of my system once and for all. And I wanted to create it from scratch, but try to stay
    somewhat faithful to the spirit of the original game.
